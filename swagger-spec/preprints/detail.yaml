      summary: Retrieve a preprint
      description: >-
        Retrieves the details of a preprint.

        #### Returns

        A dictionary with a `data` property containing the representation of the requested
        preprint, if the request was successful.


        If the request was unsuccessful, a dictionary with an `errors` property containing
        information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes]()
        to understand why a preprint may have failed to be retrieved.

        Updates the specified preprint by setting the values of the parameters passed.
        Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.

        #### Returns

        A dictionary with a `data` property containing the new representation of the updated
        preprint, if the request was successful.


        If the request was unsuccessful, a dictionary with an `errors` property containing
        information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes]()
        to understand why a preprint may have failed to update.

    delete:
      summary: Delete a preprint
      description: >-
        Permanently deletes a preprint. This action cannot be undone.


        Deleting a preprint **does not** delete the OSF project that the preprint
        was related to. (TODO: check if I'm lying here or not)

        #### Returns

        If the request is successful, no content is returned.


        If the request was unsuccessful, a dictionary with an `errors` property containing
        information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes]()
        to understand why a preprint may have failed to delete.
