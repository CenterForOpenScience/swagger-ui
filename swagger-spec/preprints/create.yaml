    Preprints that represent a special kind of preprint node. *Writeable*.


    Paginated list of preprints ordered by their `date_created`.  Each
    resource contains a representation of the

    preprint.


    ##Preprint Attributes


    OSF Preprint entities have the "preprints" `type`.


    name                            type
    description

    ====================================================================================

    date_created                    iso8601 timestamp
    timestamp that the preprint was created

    date_modified                   iso8601 timestamp
    timestamp that the preprint was last modified

    date_published                  iso8601 timestamp
    timestamp when the preprint was published

    is_published                    boolean
    whether or not this preprint is published

    is_preprint_orphan              boolean
    whether or not this preprint is orphaned

    subjects                        list of lists of dictionaries       ids
    of Subject in the PLOS taxonomy. Dictionary, containing the subject text
    and subject ID

    doi                             string                              bare
    DOI for the manuscript, as entered by the user


    ##Relationships


    ###Node

    The node that this preprint was created for


    ###Primary File

    The file that is designated as the preprint's primary file, or the
    manuscript of the preprint.


    ###Provider

    Link to preprint_provider detail for this preprint


    ##Links


    - `self` -- Preprint detail page for the current preprint

    - `html` -- Project on the OSF corresponding to the current preprint

    - `doi` -- URL representation of the DOI entered by the user for the
    preprint manuscript


    See the [JSON-API spec regarding
    pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


    ##Query Params


    + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
    results on.


    Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`,
    `date_modified`, `provider`

    Most are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring
    matching.


    ###Creating New Preprints


    Create a new preprint by posting to the guid of the existing **node**,
    including the file_id for the

    file you'd like to make the primary preprint file. Note that the **node
    id** will not be accessible via the

    preprints detail view until after the preprint has been created.
