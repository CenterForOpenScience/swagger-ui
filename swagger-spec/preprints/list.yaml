get:
  summary: List all preprints
  description: >-

    A paginated list of preprints from all preprint providers.
    The returned preprints are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent
    preprints appearing first.

    #### Returns

    A dictionary with a `data` and `links` property.


    The `data` property contains an array of 10 preprints.
    Each resource in the array is a separate preprint object.
    The `links` property contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include preprints that
    match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/?filter[provider]=socarxiv.


    Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`,
    `date_modified`, and `provider`.
