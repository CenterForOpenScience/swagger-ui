    #### Testing Server

    The test-* subdomains of the osf are intended to match, at any given time, the current production environment of the Open Science Framework.


    We have staging servers that will have newer features, including newer API features, that aren't ready for production.
    However, because those servers are subject to the whims of QA and whichever group needs to do specific testing, they aren't particular stable for API developers.


    The test servers linked below are primarily for developing your API application on a stable system.


    https://test.osf.io/


    https://test-api.osf.io/v2/

    #### Ephemerality Notice

    Expect the server to be down from time to time while we update software, and don't expect that anything you create on here to exist long-term.


    While this is more stable than a staging server, we won't necessarily run data migrations if anything major happens to our database schema, so we may clear out the data on the test servers periodically.
