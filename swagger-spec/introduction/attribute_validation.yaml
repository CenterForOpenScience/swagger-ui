  summary: Attribute Validation
  description: >-
    Endpoints that allow creation or modification of entities generally limit updates to certain attributes of the entity.


    If you attempt to set an attribute that does not permit updates (such as a `date_created` timestamp), the API will silently ignore that attribute.


    This will not affect the response from the API: if the request would have succeeded without the updated attribute, it will still report as successful.
    Likewise, if the request would have failed without the attribute update, the API will still report a failure.


    Typoed or non-existent attributes will behave the same as non-updatable attributes and will be silently ignored.
    If a request is not working the way you expect, make sure to double check your spelling.
