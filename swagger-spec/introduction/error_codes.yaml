  summary: Error Codes
  description: >-
    The OSF API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.


    In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success,
    codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
    (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid authentication credentials were provided, etc.),
    and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API servers (these are rare, and if they occur consistently, should be [reported](mailto:support@osf.io)).


    `200` **OK**


    The request was successful and everything worked as expected.


    `201` **Created**


    The request was successful and a new resource was created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the ID returned in the response.


    `204` **No Content**


    The request was sucessful but does not need to return an entity-body.


    `400` **Bad Request**


    The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing required parameter or malformed data.


    `401` **Unauthorized**


    The request requires user authentication, which was not provided.


    `403` **Forbidden**


    The request was understood but not fulfilled, most likely due to invalid permissions.


    `404` **Not Found**


    The requested resource does not exist.


    `405` **Method Not Allowed**


    The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.


    `409` **Conflict**


    The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource or within the request data.


    `410` **Gone**


    The requested resource is no longer available, most likely because it was deleted.


    `429` **Too Many Requests**


    The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.


    Wait at least the amount of time specified in the `Retry-After` header of the response before sending another request.


    [Authenticated](#Introduction_authentication) requests have a rate limit of 10,000/day.


    Unauthenticated requests have a rate limit of 100/hour.


    `5xx` **Server Errors**


    The API server encountered an unexpected error.
