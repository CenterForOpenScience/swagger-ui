    Versioning can be specified in three different ways:


    #### URL Path Versioning

    + `/v2/` or `/v3/`

    + A version specified via the URL path is a **required** part of the
    URL.

    + Only a major version can be specified via the URL path, i.e.
    `/v2.0.6/` is invalid, additionally, paths such as `/v2.0/` are invalid.

    + If the default version of the API is within the major version
    specified in the URL path, the default version will be applied (i.e. if
    the default version is `2.3` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then version
    returned will be `2.3`).

    + If the default version of the API is not within the major version
    specified in the URL path, the URL path version will be applied (i.e. if
    the default version is `3.0` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then the
    version returned will be `2.0`)


    #### Query Parameter Versioning

    + `/v2/nodes/?version=2.1.6`

    + Pinning to a specific version via a query parameter is **optional**.

    + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can
    be specified via the `version` query parameter, as long as it is an
    allowed version.

    + If the version specified in the query parameter does not fall within
    the same major version specified in the URL path, i.e
    `/v2/nodes/?version=3.1.4` a 409 Conflict response will be returned.


    #### Header Versioning

    + `Accept-Header=application/vnd.api+json;version=3.0.1`

    + Pinning to a specific version via request header is **optional**.

    + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can
    be specified via the `Accept Header` of the request, as long as it is an
    allowed version.

    + If the version specified in the header does not fall within the same
    major version specified in the URL path a 409 Conflict response will be
    returned.

    + If both a header version and query parameter version are specified,
    the versions must match exactly or a 409 Conflict response will be
    returned (i.e. one does not take precedence over the other).
