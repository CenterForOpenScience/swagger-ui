  summary: Entity Collections
  description: >-
    Entity collection endpoints return a list of entities and an additional data structure with pagination links,
    such as `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last`.


    The OSF API limits all entity collection responses to a maximum of 10 entities.


    The response object has two keys:

    #### Data

    The `data` key is an array of entities that match the query.


    Each entity in the array is the same representation that is returned from that entity's `self` link, meaning that refetching the entity is unnecessary.

    #### Links

    The `links` key contains pagination information, including links to the previous, next, first, and last pages of results.


    The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.


    If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` values will be null.
