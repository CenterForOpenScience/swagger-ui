  summary: General Usage
  description: >-
    The OSF API generally conforms to the [JSON-API v1.0 spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/).
    Where exceptions exist, they will be noted.
    Each endpoint will have its own documentation, but there are some general principles.


    Note: Assume undocumented routes/features/fields are unstable.


    #### Canonical URLs

    All canonical URLs have trailing slashes.  A request to an endpoint
    without a trailing slash will result in a **301 Redirect** to the canonical
    URL.  There are some exceptions when working with the Files API, so if a
    URL in a response does not have a slash, do not append one.

    #### Plurals

    Endpoints are always pluralized.  `/users/`, not `/user/`, `/nodes/`,
    not `/node/`.


    The only exception are the node and preprint citation endpoints, which are `/citation/`, not
    `/citations/`.

    #### Common Actions

    Every endpoint in the OSF API responds to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTION` requests.


    You must have adequate permissions to interact with any endpoint.
    Unauthorized use will result in **401 Unauthorized** or **403 Forbidden** responses.


    Use `HEAD` to probe an endpoint and make sure your headers are well-formed.


    A `GET` request will return a representation of the entity or entity collection referenced by the endpoint.


    An `OPTIONS` request will return a JSON object that describes the endpoint, including the name, a description, the acceptable request formats, the allowed response formats, and any actions available via the endpoint.
