  summary: Embedding
  description: >-
    All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute are embeddable,
    meaning it is possible to fetch a node and its contributors in a single request by adding a query parameter like:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors`


    The embedded results will have the following structure:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`{relationship_name}: {full_embedded_response}`


    Where `full_embedded_response` means the full API response resulting from a **GET** request to the `href` link of the corresponding related
    resource.


    This means if there are no errors in processing the embedded request the response will have the format:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`data: {response}`


    And if there are errors processing the embedded request the response will have the format:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`errors: {errors}`


    Multiple embeds can be achieved with multiple query parameters separated by "&".


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors&embed=comments`


    Some endpoints are automatically embedded, such as the [node contributors](TODO: link me) endpoint, which automatically embeds user information.
