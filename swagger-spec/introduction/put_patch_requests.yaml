    #Formatting POST/PUT/PATCH request bodies

    The OSF API follows the JSON-API spec for [create and update requests](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#crud).  This means
    all request bodies must be wrapped with some metadata.  Each request body must be an object with a `data` key
    containing at least a `type` member.  The value of the `type` member must agree with the `type` of the entities
    represented by the endpoint.  If not, a 409 Conflict will be returned.  The request should also contain an
    `attributes` member with an object containing the key-value pairs to be created/updated.  PUT/PATCH requests must
    also have an `id` key that matches the id part of the endpoint.  If the `id` key does not match the id path part, a
    409 Conflict error will be returned.

    #Example 1: Creating a Node via POST

        POST /v2/nodes/
        {
          "data": {
            "type": "nodes",
            "attributes": {
              "title" : "A Phylogenetic Tree of Famous Internet Cats",
              "category" : "project",
              "description" : "How closely related are Grumpy Cat and C.H. Cheezburger? Is memefulness inheritable?"
            }
          }
        }

    #Example 2: Updating a User via PUT

        PUT /v2/users/me/
        {
          "data": {
            "id": "3rqxc",
            "type": "users",
            "attributes": {
              "full_name" : "Henrietta Swan Leavitt",
              "given_name" : "Henrietta",
              "middle_names" : "Swan",
              "family_name" : "Leavitt"
            }
          }
        }

    **NB:** If you PUT/PATCH to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user id in the `id` field of
    the request.  We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.

    #PUT vs. PATCH

    For most endpoints that support updates via PUT requests, we also allow PATCH updates. The only difference is that
    PUT requests require all mandatory attributes to be set, even if their value is unchanged. PATCH requests may omit
    mandatory attributes, whose value will be unchanged.
