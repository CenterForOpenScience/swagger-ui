  summary: Errors
  description: >-
    When a request fails for any reason, the OSF API will return an appropriate [HTTP response code](#Introduction_error_codes) and include a descriptive error in the body of the response.


    The response body will be a JSON object with a key, `errors`, pointing to an array of error objects.


    In general, these error objects will consist of a `detail` key with a detailed error message and a `source` object that may contain a field `pointer` that is a
    [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the error-causing attribute.


    The `error` objects may include additional information in accordance with the [JSON-API error spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#error-objects).


    #### Example

    An error response from an incorrect create node request:

        {
          "errors": [
            {
              "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/attributes/category"
              },
              "detail": "This field is required."
            },
            {
              "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/type"
              },
              "detail": "This field may not be null."
            },
            {
              "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/attributes/title"
              },
              "detail": "This field is required."
            }
          ]
        }
