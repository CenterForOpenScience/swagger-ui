  summary: Pagination
  description: >-
    All entity collection endpoints respond to the `page` query parameter behavior as described in the [JSON-API pagination spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#crud).


    However, links to the first, last, previous, and next pages of results are provided in the `links` key of the response,
    and you are encouraged to use those rather than adding query parameters by hand.


    If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` links will be null.


    The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.
