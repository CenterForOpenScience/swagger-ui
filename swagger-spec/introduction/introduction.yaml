    Welcome to the Open Science Framework API. With this API you can access
    users, projects, components, logs, and files from the [Open Science
    Framework](https://osf.io/). The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free,
    open-source service maintained by the [Center for Open
    Science](http://cos.io/).


    The OSF serves as a repository and archive for study designs, materials,
    data, manuscripts, or anything else associated with your research during
    the research process. Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent
    unique identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped
    version of your projects and files) can be assigned a DOI/ARK. You can
    use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the traffic to projects
    and files you make public. With the OSF you have full control of what
    parts of your research are public and what remains private.


    Beta notice: This API is currently a beta service.  You are encouraged
    to use the API and will receive support

    when doing so, however, while the API remains in beta status, it may
    change without notice as a result of product updates. The temporary beta
    status of the API will remain in place while it matures. In a future
    release, the beta status will be removed, at which point we will provide
    details on how long we will support the API V2 and under what
    circumstances it might change.
