    #Filtering

    Entity collections can be filtered by adding a query parameter in the
    form:


    ```filter[<fieldname>]=<matching information>```


    String queries are filtered using substring matching. For example, if
    you were trying to find [Lise
    Meitner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner):


    ```/users/?filter[full_name]=meitn```


    You can filter on multiple fields, or the same field in different ways,
    by &-ing the query parameters together.


    ```/users/?filter[full_name]=lise&filter[family_name]=mei```


    Boolean fields should be queried with `true` or `false`.


    ```/nodes/?filter[registered]=true```


    You can request multiple resources by filtering on id and placing
    comma-separated values in your query parameter.


    ```/nodes/?filter[id]=aegu6,me23a```


    You can filter with case-sensitivity or case-insensitivity by using
    `contains` and `icontains`, respectively.


    ```/nodes/?filter[tags][icontains]=help```


    #Embedding
        All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute are embeddable, meaning that by adding a query parameter like:

    /nodes/?embed=contributors


    it is possible to fetch a Node and its contributors in a single request.
    The embedded results will have the following structure:


    {relationship_name}: {full_embedded_response}


    Where `full_embedded_response` means the full API response resulting
    from a GET request to the `href` link of the corresponding related
    resource. This means if there are no errors in processing the embedded
    request the response will have the format:


    data: {response}


    And if there are errors processing the embedded request the response
    will have the format:


    errors: {errors}


    Multiple embeds can be achieved with multiple query parameters separated
    by "&".


    /nodes/?embed=contributors&embed=comments


    Some endpoints are automatically embedded.
