  summary: Entities
  description: >-
    An entity is a single resource that has been retrieved from the API, usually from an endpoint with the entity's ID as the final path part.
    A successful response from an entity request will be a JSON object with a top level `data` key pointing to a sub-object with the following members:

    #### ID

    The identifier for the entity.  This **MUST** be included with all PUT and PATCH requests.

    #### Type

    The type identifier of this entity.  This **MUST** be included with all create and update requests.

    #### Attributes

    The properties of the entity.  Names, descriptions, etc.

    #### Relationships

    Relationships are URLs to other entities or entity collections that have a relationship to the entity.


    For example, the node entity provides a `contributors` relationship that points to the endpoint to retrieve all contributors to that node.
    It is recommended to use these links rather than to filter general entity collection endpoints by IDs.
    They'll be faster, easier, and less error-prone.


    Generally a relationship will have the following structure:


        {relationship_name}: {
          "links": {
            "related": {
              "href": {url_to_related_entity_or_entity_collection},
              "meta": {}
            }
          }
        }


    If there are no related entities, `href` will be null.

    #### Embeds

    Please see the [embedding](#Introduction_embedding) documentation.

    #### Links

    Links are urls to alternative representations of the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.


    Most entities will provide a `self` link that is the canonical endpoint for the entity where update and delete requests should be sent.
    Most entities will also provide an `html` link that directs to the entity's page on the Open Science Framework.
