    An entity is a single resource that has been retrieved from the API, usually from an endpoint with the entity's id
    as the final path part.  A successful response from an entity request will be a JSON object with a top level `data`
    key pointing to a sub-object with the following members:

    + `id`

    The identifier for the entity.  This MUST be included with [PUT and PATCH
    requests](#formatting-postputpatch-request-bodies).

    + `type`

    The type identifier of this entity.  This MUST be included with [all create/update
    requests](#formatting-postputpatch-request-bodies).

    + `attributes`

    The properties of the entity.  Names, descriptions, etc.

    + `relationships`

    Relationships are urls to other entities or entity collections that have a relationship to the entity. For example,
    the node entity provides a `contributors` relationship that points to the endpoint to retrieve all contributors to
    that node.  It is recommended to use these links rather than to id-filter general entity collection endpoints.
    They'll be faster, easier, and less error-prone.  Generally a relationship will have the following structure:

        {relationship_name}: {
            "links": {
                "related": {
                    "href": {url_to_related_entity_or_entity_collection},
                    "meta": {}
                }
            }
        }

    If there are no related entities, `href` will be null.

    + `embeds`

    Please see `Embedding` documentation under `Requests`.

    + `links`

    Links are urls to alternative representations of the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.  Most
    entities will provide a `self` link that is the canonical endpoint for the entity where update and delete requests
    should be sent.  In-depth documentation of actions is available by navigating to the `self` link in the Browsable
    API.  Most entities will also provide an `html` link that directs to the entity's page on the [OSF](http://osf.io/).
