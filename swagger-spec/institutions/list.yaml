get:
  summary: Retrieve all institutions
  description: >-

    A paginated list of all verified institutions.

    #### Returns

    JSON with keys for `data` and `links`.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 institutions.
    Each resource in the array is a separate institution object.


    The `links` property contains JSON of links that can be used
    for [pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include institutions that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/?filter[id]=cos.


    Institutions may be filtered by their `id`, `name`, and `auth_url`
