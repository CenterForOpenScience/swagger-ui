#/registrations/{node_id}/contributors/{user_id}
get:
  summary: Retrieve a contributor
  description: >-
    Retrieves the details of a contributor for a registration.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic".
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.


    Contributors can be viewed, removed, and have their permissions and bibliographic status changed via this endpoint.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested
    contributor, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.
