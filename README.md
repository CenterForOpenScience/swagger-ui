### OSF API Documentation
The openapi specification and source code for the documenting the Open Science Framework API lives here.

#### For development:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build` (to build a new distribution under the dist/ folder)
- `npm run serve` (to serve the built result at localhost:8090)
*note*: to change the port, update the `connect` gulp task in `gulpfile.js`

#### Spec Validation
- `npm install -g swagger-cli`
- `swagger validate swagger.yaml` (bundles and validates the given specification against the OpenAPI 2.0 schema and spec)
- `swagger bundle -o <output_file_name> swagger.yaml` (bundles a multi-file specification into a single file)

#### OpenAPI Specification
- The openapi specification for the OSF API lives in [swagger-spec/swagger.yaml](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/blob/master/swagger-spec/swagger.yaml) and contains references to many YAML files in the [swagger-spec](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/tree/master/swagger-spec) directory.

  ##### Editing the OpenAPI Specification
  - As a general rule, the [swagger.yaml](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/blob/master/swagger-spec/swagger.yaml) file should be kept **as minimal as possible**, meaning `$refs` to other YAML files should be utilized over inline endpoint and model definitions.
  - Each collection of related endpoints is contained in it's own folder in the [swagger-spec](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/tree/master/swagger-spec) directory (i.e. [swagger-spec/preprints/](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/tree/master/swagger-spec/preprints)), with each unique API endpoint having it's own YAML file (i.e. [detail.yaml](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/blob/master/swagger-spec/preprints/detail.yaml) and [list.yaml](https://github.com/caseyrollins/swagger-ui/blob/master/swagger-spec/preprints/list.yaml) for `/preprints/` and `/preprints/{preprint_id}/`, respectively).
  - The specification should *always* conform to the official OpenAPI specification (v2.0), described in detail [here](http://swagger.io/specification/).
